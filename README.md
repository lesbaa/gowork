gowork
======

This is just some bash stuff to get me going in the morning.

### Prerequisites

- VSCode.
- MacOS (uses applescript).
- iTerm.
- Assorted other apps (just look at the code).

### Usage

If you have `gowork` in your `$PATH` then all you need is:

`gowork [-sfcpm] <project-name>`

And that's it.
